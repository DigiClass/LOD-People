Further notes:
1. “Object ID” is always the MANTO URI for the entity in the previous column, which creates URL with https://resource.manto.unh.edu/ ….
1. “Alternative name for” marks subsidiary entities which are not individuated “people”, but only represent mythically significant forms of their names.
1. “Possibly same as” means that there is not enough information in the ancient tradition to determine whether the entities are the same or different.  Four columns required for reversals.
1. “Rationalized form of / Rationalized form” = specific to mythic traditions of historicist rationalisation.
1. “Personification of” = related to landscape feature (e.g. river god)
1. “Identified with the author” = mythic person to whom are also attributed fragements or texts, so exists in MANTO also in the dataset of authors.
1. Alignments to WD, PALP, Digital LIMC: full urls are here (e.g): https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8188175
1. Gender: options are male, female, or “undefined” (= group of mixed genders; agents where the gender is either uncertain, or changeable between sources).
1. “Part of” establishes hierarchy of groups of people within other groups.
